Changes between gnuplot versions 3.7.2 and 4.0
==============================================

Below you find list of news, changes and fixes in gnuplot version 4.0
and older.

Please see also section "What is New in Version 4.0" in gnuplot documentation
(files gnuplot.gih, gnuplot.hlp, gnuplot.inf, etc.) available by the command
    gnuplot> help new
from gnuplot 4.0. You may find it also in files gnuplot.pdf, gnuplot.html
or gnuplot.info optionally available in your distribution, or online at
    http://www.gnuplot.info/docs/gnuplot.html#What_is_New_in_Version_4.0


Mouse and hotkey support in screen terminals

  The pm, x11, ggi and windows terminals support interactive work with mouse
  and hotkeys. The usage of the mouse is mainly self-explanatory. Just type 'h'
  in the graph window (hereafter we mean either PM, X11, ... terminal window)
  and a short overview of commands will pop up. The mouse is turned on and off
  with the hotkey 'm'. See 'help mouse' and 'help bind' for more details.

  The coordinates of mouse clicks are exported to variables MOUSE_X, MOUSE_Y,
  MOUSE_X2, MOUSE_Y2, and MOUSE_BUTTON accessible from the gnuplot command
  line. This allows gnuplot scripts to alter their behaviour based on
  interactive mouse input. See 'help mouse variables' and 'help pause mouse',
  and the example script demo/mousevariables.dem. Further it allows interaction
  of a gnuplot mouseable terminal and external programs in C, Python, Octave,
  etc. using gnuplot as their graph engine. This is demonstrated on gnuplot web
  page in section "Programming interfaces - bidirectional interaction".
