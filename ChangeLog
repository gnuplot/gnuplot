2012-12-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (enhanced_recursion):  Depending on the terminal type and
	the current encoding, improper enhanced text syntax could cause anything
	from garbage text to a segfault:
	  set termopt enhanced; 
	  set label "~"; plot [0:1][0:1] '+' using 1:1:("~^") with labels
	Bugfix

	* src/gplt_x11.c:  Change the fallback font string used when the current
	encoding is UTF-8 (iso10646-1) or when all else fails (iso8859-1).  This
	is admitted biased towards English as a default, but the previous string
	(*-*) does not work for common recent x11 implementations.

2012-12-16  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* demo/key.dem src/graph3d.c (boundary3d do_3d_key_layout)
	src/graphics.c (boundary do_key_layout do_key_bounds draw_key):
	Refactor code the key box layout code to repair several problems.
	- left/right/center was not honored for an explicit key position
	- incorrect key placement due to subscript or superscript in key title
	- text spacing should be based on key font, not on the default font
	- vertical centering of text in key samples was incorrect
	Remaining problems:
	- postscript terminal does incorrect vertical centering (vshift)
	- maxcols is never checked in the splot key layout code
	Bug #3556892  and other issues visible in key.dem

	* term/post.trm (set_font): Quick fix to redefine vshift every time the
	current font size changes. A better fix would query the font internally.

	* term/svg.trm (set_font): Similar fix for svg font metrics.

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c (gp_cairo_draw_text):  And for wxt.

2012-12-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c:  If a data column requested by name is not found,
	treat it as undefined (DF_UNDEFINED) rather than terminating data input
	with int_error().  This makes the treatment of named columns more like
	that of numbered columns.
	Bug #3595672

	* src/save.c src/set.c src/show.c:  The hypertext flag on labels was
	being ignored by save and show commands.  Setting the flag worked only
	for certain orders of `set` options.
	Bugfix

	* src/datafile.c src/graph3d.h src/graphics.h src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c
	demo/piecewise.dem docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Extend the support for piecewise sampling ranges, in particular the use
	of named variables in piecewise functions.  Allow 1-dimensional 
	parametric functions in 3D. For example, to plot a helix
	  splot [-2:2][-2:2] sample [h=1:10] '+' using (cos(h)):(sin(h)):(h)

2012-12-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/svg.trm:  Background color 0x0 was incorrectly interpreted as
	"none" rather than "black". Bugfix.

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Update new features section.

2012-11-29  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* config/watcom/.cvsignore: Ignore gnerated file.

	* docs/psdoc/.cvsignore: Ignore generated files.

	* docs/.cvsignore: Ignore Makefile.in, now that it is a generated file.

	* src/qtterminal/.cvsignore: Ignore Makefile.in, since it is a generated file.

	* term/x11.trm (X11_options): Calls to strncat were risking buffer
	overflow by not accounting for the terminating '\0'.  Replace some
	buffer size macros by actual size of buffer.

	* term/wxt.trm (wxt_options): Dito.

	* term/cairo.trm (cairotrm_options): Dito.

	* src/win/pgnuplot.c (main): Dito.

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c (gp_cairo_add_shape, gp_cairo_enhanced_flush): Dito.

	* term/context.trm (CONTEXT_options): Dito.  And let break
	statements have their own lines instead of hiding them at the end
	of a wrapped function call.

	* src/axis.h (AXIS_INDEX, FIRST_AXES, SECOND_AXES): Replace magic
	numbers by references to existing entries.
	(AXIS_INDEX): Replace macro NO_AXIS by enum entry, to avoid
	warnings about mixing enum with non-enum values.
	(STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE): No need to invoke strcmp()
	where a simple comparison of enums would suffice.

	* src/help.c (ShowSubtopics): Replace magic numbers by actual
	buffer sizes and string lengths involved.

	* src/command.c (read_line): Replace magic number by expression
	based on actual buffer size.

	* src/gp_types.h (PLOT_STYLE): New enum entry PLOT_STYLE_NONE, to
	be used instead of magic number -1.

	* src/misc.c (get_style): Use new enum entry.

	* src/tables.c (plotstyle_tbl): Use new enum entry.

	* src/save.c (save_data_func_style): Use new enum entry.

	* src/graph3d.c (do_3dplot): Use new enum entry.

2012-11-26  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c src/win/winmain.c|h (WinMessageLoop) src/win/wtext.c:
	Move Windows message handling from TextMessage() to new WinMessageLoop()
	and make it accessible in Windows console mode.

	* src/command.c (pause_command): In Windows console mode, handle case
	when current terminal does not have a waitforinput method. Bug fix.

	* src/term.c (write_multiline): Fix alignment of right- or center-
	justified text for terminals which do not have a justify method.

	* src/graphics.c (do_rectangle): Add newpath/closepath calls.

	* src/show.c (show_version): If the environment variable GNUPLOT_PS_DIR
	was set, show its value instead of the compile time setting.

	* src/fit.c: Test for error scaling when printing results.

2012-11-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/datafile.c src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c
	src/fit.c demo/piecewise.dem:
	Add support for piecewise functions by adding an optional sampling range
	at the beginning of each element in a plot command. For example, to plot
	a data set and three separate functions covering parts of the range:
	    plot DATA, [10:20] f(x), [25:35] g(x), [40:*] '+' using 1:(h($1))

	* term/svg.trm:  Support for dashlength

	* src/set.c src/tables.c:  Allow "set termoption dashlength <foo>"
	* term/{canvas cgm emf gd metapost pdf post}.trm:
	Recognize 'set termoption' even when not the first command on a line.

2012-11-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c src/parse.c:  Internal implementation of a pseudocolumn
	(-3) that means "last column in input file".  I.e. if the input file has
	19 columns then column(-3) is treated as column(19). It might be nice to
	wrap this so that the user interface is something like column(LAST), but
	that remains to be done.

	* src/hidden3d.c:  Handle explicit surface in hidden3d mode.

2012-11-20  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c:  Truncate requested column number to maximum sane
	value. This prevents segfault on "plot $foo using 1 title column(12345)"

	* src/parse.c (parse_unary_expression):
	Collapse two operations PUSHC <pos-const> + UMINUS
	into a single operation PUSHC <neg-const>
	This saves both space and time when evaluating negative numbers, but the
	direct motivation is to make it easier to treat functions of a constant
	value as a special case.

2012-11-17  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c (plotrequest):  Fix bug introduced by 2012-11-12 patch
	(failure to recognize nonparametric named variables).

	* src/graphics.c (boundary): Since the vertical height of each text
	element depends on the font it uses, temporarily set the font while 
	calculating the height of that element.  This can result in a different
	placement compared to previous versions when a non-default font is used.

	* demo/named_var.dem demo/rugplot.dem demo/all.dem demo/simple.dem:
	Add a unit test for the use of a nonparametric named variable;
	it would have caught the above named variable bug!
	Add a title to simple.dem illustrating the effect of font size on
	placement.  Add a rugplot demo.  Less screen output from fit demo.

2012-11-15  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/tabulate.c:  Fix the hexadecimal format used to output RGB color

	* term/js/canvasmath.js:  Additional UTF-8 mathematical operators

	* term/canvas.trm:  Retain the initial font size for later use.
	Reset dashed line status before filled box or polygon (not sure why
	this is necessary, but omitting it causes strange things to happen).

	* src/gplt_x11.c:  Depending on the order of linetype changes, the
	code could fail to reset the current linewidth.
	Bug #3348942

2012-11-12  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/fit.c src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c:
	Merge parse_range() and parse_named_range() into a single routine.
	Clean up the code and the call sites.

	* src/datafile.c (plot_option_using):  Restore a check for a format 
	spec given after the list of columns (e.g. plot XX using 1:2 "%lf; %lf")
	that was lost in a code reorganization and missing in 4.6.0 and 4.6.1.
	Bug #3586441

	* src/command.c (pause_command):  Further cleanup of the code that 
	waits for input after a "pause -1" command.  Eat up characters from
	stdin one by one until a \n is encountered.  No need to store them.

	* src/plot2d.c (check_or_add_boxplot_factor):  Fix memory leak.

	* demos (various): Tweak demos so that they exercise more options,
	giving more coverage of the code when used as a set of unit tests.

2012-11-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (parse_color_name) share/gnuplotrc:  If the expression in
	`linecolor rgb <expression>` is not interpretable as a color name or 
	hexadecimal string "#RRGGBB" then treat it as an integer representing
	AARRGGBB.  Provide examples in gnuplotrc of user-defined functions to
	map RGB or HSV colors using the [0:1] range onto gnuplot's "#AARRGGBB"
	hexadecimal string notation.

2012-11-08  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/gplt_x11.c:  Revise placement of the %n format used to read from
	the input stream. This avoids an ambiguity in the standard for treating
	spaces immediately preceding %n.

2012-11-07  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c (gen_tics):  Axis tic labels provided by the user as string
	constants were arbitrarily truncated to MAX_ID_LEN before printing.
	No truncation is necessary.
	Bug #3585182

	* src/axis.c (setup_tics) src/plot2d.c (eval_plots):
	Enable auto-scaling for data sets plotted using the secondary axis
	of a linked axis pair.  E.g.   set link y; plot FOO axes x1y2

	* src/set.c (set_encoding):  Fix memory leak.

2012-11-04  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/util.c (gprintf): Ever since the gprintf routine was added
	(sometime before version 3.7) the count parameter that should limit how
	many characters are written on output has been silently ignored.
	Obviously this can lead to buffer overflows, the simplest case being a
	format consisting of a string constant with length > MAX_ID_LEN.
	Revise gprintf() to use snprintf() and safe_strncpy() throughout.
	Bug #3577439

2012-11-03  Clement Law  <themanifold@gmail.com>

	* src/pm3d.c src/pm3d.h src/save.c src/set.c src/show.c:
	Add rms option for 'set pm3d corners2color'.

2012-11-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/gplt_x11.c: Yet another bug fix for the new text fragment format.

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp
	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWidget.cpp:  Fix mouse tracking and resize
	events for persistent qt windows.

2012-10-31  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/parse.c (parse_reset_after_error) src/parse.h src/util.c:
	Error exit from inside try_to_get_string() left the internal flags for
	string parsing in an incorrect state.  Provide a reset routine.

	* src/mouse.c (event_buttonrelease): Save/restore event parameters
	across the check for a user command bound to a mouse button.

2012-10-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c: Fix a coding error, (sizeof((char *)buf) rather than
	(strlen((char *)buf)), that can cause a buffer overrun on 64-bit
	machines.  Found by valgrind.

	* src/gplt_x11.c: The new read format for text fragments passed from
	x11.trm was missing a space.  Bugfix.

2012-10-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graph3d.c: Save axis scaling for 3D 'set view map' plots so
	that outboard drivers can continue mousing in -persist mode.

	* term/canvas.trm term/svg.trm: Sort out the up/down polarity of
	mousing limits in 3D 'set view map' plots. Bug #3581514

	* src/term.c src/term_api.h term/xlib.trm: Remove vestigial traces
	of ipc_back_fd outside of its scope (term.c).

	* term/debug.trm: Add entry points for filled_polygon, layer,
	set_color, path, image.

	* src/term.c src/gadgets.c src/set.c term/README:  Add a default
	routine null_set_font() so that code does not have to test every
	time whether the current terminal supports term->set_font() or not.

	* src/color.c src/color.h src/eval.c src/getcolor.c src/getcolor.h
	docs/gnuplot.doc:  
	New user-visible function hsv2rgb(H,S,V) creates a 24-bit RGB value
	from real H,S,V values in the range [0:1]. This allows use of hsv colors
	in plots with coloring style "rgb variable".  The new function can be
	used to implement the capability suggested by Shige Takeno:
	  hsv(h,s,v) = sprintf("#%06x",hsv2rgb(h,s,v))
	  plot FOO lc rgb hsv(H,S,V)

	* demo/all.dem demo/complex_trig.dem demo/html/index.canvas
	demo/html/index.save demo/html/index.svg demo/html/Makefile
	demo/rgb_variable.dem:  Demos for HSV coloring, including a new demo
	for complex-valued trig functions.

2012-10-26  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/mouse.c src/mouse.h src/mousecmn.h src/term_api.h:  
	Allow the "bind" command to attach a user command to mouse button 1,
	at least for 2D plots.

2012-10-22  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/xlib.trm: Reset X11_ipc when xlib terminal exits; otherwise a
	subsequent "set term x11" fails to send output to gnuplot_x11.

	* term/x11.trm: Filter out redundant move/vector/set_color commands.
	- Do not send a Move or Vector command to gnuplot_x11 if the previous
	  move/vector went to the same coordinates.
	- Do not send an rgbcolor command to gnuplot_x11 if it duplicates the
	  previous rgbcolor command.
	Filtering yields a 9% reduction in the number of bytes sent from
	gnuplot to gnuplot_x11 during execution of all.dem.

2012-10-19  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* demo/html/webify.pl demo/html/webify_svg.pl demo/html/webify_canvas.pl:
	Add UTF-8 handling to web page generation.

	* src/command.c (do_string_and_free):  The "exit" command was not working
	inside a bracketed clause.  Bug #3576439

	* src/pm3d.c (pm3d_plot):  If pm3d option corners2color is 'mean' and
	the coloring option is 'rgb variable', then the code that calculates the
	mean must deal with alpha channel values as well as r/g/b components.

2012-10-19  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/gplt_x11.c src/mouse.c term/x11.trm:
	Initialize x11 terminal aspect ratio so that it works for xlib also.

2012-10-16  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/lua.trm term/lua/gnuplot-tikz.lua:  The set_font() routine must
	update term->v_char and term->h_char. set_font("") must restore the
	default font. Bugfix.

	* src/term.c (term_start_multiplot): The calculation of vertical space
	required for a plot title depends on term->v_char, which in turn depends
	on the font used for the title. Bugfix.

	* term/gd.trm (set_font): The libgd terminals were failing to 
	notice a change in font size sent by set_term(",newsize")
	Bugfix (old bug!)

	* term/canvas.trm (set_font): Minimal set_font routine for canvas
	terminal.  All it does at this point is change or restore the font size.

2012-10-14  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/gplt_x11.c: 
	With -replotonresize the resize triggered two replots, the initial
	outboard-only even-aspect-ratio one, and then the full replot.
	This fix skips the first of these.
	When the inboard driver is killed, the mouse-over coordinates were not
	computed correctly.  Bugfix.

2012-10-14  Ruediger Haertel  <haertel@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/term.c (term_start_multiplot) docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Add enhanced/noenhanced option to "set multiplot title".

2012-10-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp (qt_set_font):  term->set_font("")
	must restore the default terminal font and size.
	Bugfix.

	* src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp (qt_set_font qt_options):
	Make the current terminal font visible to the user.
	Update the font metrics whenever the font is changed.
	Bugfix.

	* demo/layout.dem: Modified to act as a test for the above bug fixes.

2012-10-12  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/svg.trm: Replace sizes given in points with sizes in user
	coordinates (nominally pixels = "px").  In empirical tests this makes
	the estimates generated for string width more accurate.  An alternative
	might be to give sizes in points multiplied by some internal variable
	that could be recalculated dynamically at display time.

	* term/svg.trm: Replace bundled style attributes with individual 
	specifications.  E.g.   
	    <g style="fill:none; stroke:rgb(0,0,0); font-size:10pt">
	becomes
	    <g fill="none" stroke="rgb(0,0,0)" font-size="10">

	* src/graph3d.c:  Suppress drawing of a degenerate keybox when
	"set key box" but no plot titles.  Bugfix.

	* src/graph3d.c src/show.c:  "set zlabel rotate parallel" should have
	the same effect as "set zlabel rotate".  Bugfix.

	* src/unset.c: `unset xrange` has done nothing but clear range_reverse.
	Make it also restore the default autoscaling and axis ranges.

2012-10-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWidget.cpp (exportToSvg):
	Restrict svg output size to scaled viewport.  This gets rid of the
	oversize border around a plot exported from the qt terminal to svg.
	Empirical fix, results not guaranteed!
	Bug #3573897

2012-10-09  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.h src/interpol.c src/plot2d.c docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Make the bandwidth parameter of "smooth kdensity" a constant specified 
	in the plot command rather than a per-data point variable.  The latter
	has no obvious physical meaning and anyhow is problematic because it
	overloads the meaning of the 3rd 'using' spec.  New syntax:
	    plot foo smooth kdensity {bandwidth <val>}
	If no value is given, or if the value in negative, use the calculated
	optimum bandwidth.  Store the value used in GPVAL_KDENSITY_BANDWIDTH.

	* src/term.h:  Remove regis from the default set of supported terminals

2012-10-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c (get_data) src/datafile.c (df_readascii) src/gp_types.h:
	Handle NaN pixels in image plots read in from non-matrix data.
	Handle NaN pixels in pm3d surfaces created by singularities in 
	harmonic mean.
	
	* src/pm3d.c (geomean4 harmean4 pm3d_plot): Revise geomean4():
	All corners positive => return positive geometric mean.
	All corners negative => return negative geometric mean.
	Otherwise return zero (previously the function returned something
	peculiar if 1 or 3 corners were negative).

2012-10-08  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c (WndGraphProc): Implement space-raises-console
	for console mode gnuplot.

	* src/win/wtext.h (getchar): Make sure that getchar is defined.

	* src/term.c (test_term): Add newpath/closepath calls were applicable.

	* src/win/wpause.c: Include command.h for pause_for_mouse. (PauseBox): 
	Do not force pause-messagebox to stay on top. (WndPauseProc): "Cancel"
	button can be activated by escape key. Code cleanup.

	* term/win.trm (WIN_filled_polygon): Filled polygon are always closed.
	Ignore the last corner if it's the same as the first one.

	* src/plot.c (gnu_main) src/win/winmain.c (main): The Windows version
	used to handle the persist command line option in winmain.c. Moving
	it to plot.c ensures that the same options are supported on all
	platforms. See Bug #3538762

	* src/win/wcommon.h src/win/wtext.c (TextShow) src/win/winmain.h
	src/win/winmain.c (WinWindowOpened, WinPersistTextClose)
	src/win/wgraph.c (WndGraphProc) src/wxterminal/wx_term.h
	src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.h src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (~wxtFrame, 
	wxtFrame::onClose, wxt_window_opened, wxt_atexit) src/plot.c (main)
	Revise handling of persist mode on Windows: Exit wgnuplot only after the
	last plot window (wxt or win) has been closed. The text window is only
	shown if "-" is given on the command line. No zombie wgnuplot process
	when closing a persistent wxt terminal window. Console gnuplot behaviour
	stays unchanged.
	Bug #3538762

2012-10-05  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* lisp/gnuplot.el: With this patch, emacs mode no longer pollutes
	global comint-mode-map. Instead it applies the key bindings only to
	the gnuplot comint instance.

2012-10-05  Vladimir  <lomov_vl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/lisp/Makefile.am: Fix typo in yesterday's revision.

2012-10-04  Clement Law  <themanifold@gmail.com>

	* src/pm3d.c src/pm3d.h src/set.c src/save.c src/show.c
	docs/gnuplot.doc demo/pm3d.dem:
	New option 'set pm3d corners2color harmean' (harmonic mean).

2012-10-04  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in prepare lisp/Makefile.am lisp/configure.in (removed):
	Simplify build scripts for the lisp files (a.k.a. emacs gnuplot-mode).

2012-10-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/gplt_x11.c:  Replace parsing using sscanf( "%d %d" ) with
	two calls to strtol().  This yields a 2-fold speedup in benchmarks
	with large numbers of points and vectors.

2012-09-28  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/gplt_x11.c src/gplt_x11.h:  Remove dead code.

	* src/gplt_x11.c term/x11.trm:  Modify format statements used to send
	commands from x11.trm to gnuplot_x11.  Before most integers were sent
	using "%04d", now " %d".  This prevents overflow for coordinate > 9999.
	The extra byte required for a 4-digit coordinate is compensated by 
	fewer bytes needed for small integers like linetype.

	* src/gplt_x11.c src/gplt_x11.h:  Adjust point size to accommodate
	changes in window size.

2012-09-26  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c src/util.c (streq) src/util.h:  New utility function
	streq(char *a, char *b) returns TRUE if a and b are identical save for
	leading and trailing whitespace.  Use this for matching requested string
	labels in a using spec to the actual column header text in a data file.
	Bug #3571243

2012-09-25  Dima Kogan  <dima@secretsauce.net>

	* src/gplt_x11.c src/mouse.c (do_event) term/x11.trm:
	Feed back the x11 window size from gnuplot_x11 to gnuplot so that
	the coordinates can be rescaled to maintain the correct aspect ratio.
	This allows correct functioning of commands like 'set size square' and
	'set view equal xyz' in an interactive x11 output window.

2012-09-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* demo/molecule.dem demo/datastrings.dem:  Remove old labelplot demo
	because it failed to show properly scaled xyz;  instead add equal xyz
	to molecule demo.

	* src/graphics.c docs/plotstyles.gnu:  Fix bug preventing explicit
	assignment of color sequence in stacked histograms.

2012-09-21  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* docs/Makefile.am lisp/Makefile.am lisp/configure.in:
	Fix breakage in "make distcheck".

2012-09-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c:  Incorrect default layout of rotated xtic labels.
	Bug #3568817

	* lisp/configure.in lisp/Makefile.am:  The autoconfigure scripting for
	the lisp directory is failing when $(EMACS) is redefined by the user.
	But the failure is only relevant to testing/patching info-look.el for
	very old versions of emacs.  Deal with it by simply assuming that
	everyone has an emacs version newer than 20.3 and therefore no patching
	is needed.

	* lisp/info-look.20.2.el lisp/info-look.20.3.el: No longer needed.

2012-09-16  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/set.c: set datafile separator {whitespace|tab|comma|"<char>"}

	* src/pm3d.c src/set.c src/color.c term/vgagl.trm src/term_api.h:
	The EXTENDED_COLOR_SPECS compile option is relevant only to one
	terminal (vgagl).  Make the corresponding toggle a terminal-specific
	flag rather than a global variable.  Clean up terminal flags.

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/mouse.c src/plot2d.c src/util.c:
	Allow zooming of plots that originally had an explicit range in the
	plot command.

	* src/set.c (set_label):  Simplify label parsing.

	* src/graphics.c (plot_filledcurves):  Use cliptorange() instead of
	simpler range check, since it handles reversed axes correctly.

2012-09-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/PostScript/prologue.ps term/post.trm:
	Handle transparent fill patterns in PS_fillbox() in the same way
	as is already done in PS_filled_polygon().
	Bug #3567035

	* src/eval.c (fill_gpval_axis) src/axis.h: The RANGE_REVERSE flag no
	longer exists, so do not report it to the user and do not swap axis
	min/max values when storing them for later mousing calculations by the
	canvas, svg, and other terminals.

	* src/datafile.c: Remove unused variables.

	* demo/html:  Update online demo collection to include linked axes
	and RGBA color applied to individual lines. 

2012-09-12  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* docs/gnuplot-ja.doc docs/term-ja.diff man/gnuplot-ja.1:
	Sync with English documentation (rev.1.746).

2012-09-11  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c:  Index histogram stacks using the point's index rather
	than its x coordinate. Fixes rowstacked histogram array overflow.
	Bug #3566662

2012-09-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/tabulate.c:  Output a column for variable color if it is used 
	in the plot command.

2012-09-04  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* term/emf.trm:  Revise the object-handling code so that the current
	brush or pen is deselected before being deleted and recreated.
	Defer application of new dash+color line properties until needed for a
	new line segment.

2012-09-04  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/emf.trm: Seek to the beginning of the output file after plotting.
	If a user mistakenly tries to place two plots in the same file, the 
	second will cleanly overwrite the first rather than corrupting it.

2012-08-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/emf.trm (EMF_dashtype):  Fix incorrect mapping of requested
	linetype to the dash pattern.  Only LT_AXIS was properly mapped.

	* term/emf.trm (EMF_set_font):  (thanks to Shige Takeno) The intended
	optimization to prevent redundant requests for the same font was not
	implemented correctly.  This change fixes it so that a new font request
	is ignored if it would reapply the current font.

	* src/axis.h (STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE) src/plot2d.c:
	Optimize out the check for linked axes when the primary axis is
	COLOR_AXIS.  This avoids a compiler warning and also reduces the
	eventual code size.

2012-08-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h (from Hans-Bernhard Broeker)
	#define AXIS_CLONE_SIZE offsetof(AXIS, linked_to_primary)

2012-08-27  Mojca Miklavec <mojca.miklavec.lists@gmail.com>

	* src/gp_types.h:  Remove superfluous comma from enum declaration.

2012-08-27  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/contour.c:  Invoke CheckZero() when automatically choosing contour
	levels.  The need for this check can be seen in contour.dem plots 19-21.

	* src/graph3d.c:  Rearrange code so that the plot key can be drawn in a
	separate pass ("set key opaque").

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp src/datafile.c term/emf.trm term/hpgl.trm:
	Trivial code cleanup to avoid compiler warnings (Sun or clang).

2012-08-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c:  Remove incorrect fall-back definition for MAXINT.
	Note:  ~0>>1  is _not_ guaranteed to shift a 0 into the high bit!

	* src/term.c src/unset.c src/term_api.h:
	Consistent with the documented generic meaning of "unset", the command
	"unset terminal" now restores the default terminal present at program
	entry.  I.e., it is equivalent to "set terminal GNUTERM".

	* src/graphics.c (do_key_layout): The height of opaque fill for the key
	box must be adjusted to allow for superscripts/subscripts in the title.
	Bug #3556892

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:
	- Add sections for "unset output" and "unset terminal".
	- Remove index entries for "set style <plotstyle>" since there is no
	  such command.
	- Bessel functions Jn and Yn by convention use a capital letter. 

2012-08-23  Thomas Gaillard <tgaillard@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/interpol.c:  Mean and sigma of kernel density function were
	incorrectly calculated.
	Bug #3519563

2012-08-22  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graph3d.c: In the code for drawing the key box and key samples,
	replace direct calls to term->move() and term->vector() with calls to
	clip_move() and clip_vector().
	Bug #3560531

	* src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c:  Downgrade detection of a trailing comma
	in a plot command to a warning rather than an error.  This allows more
	convenient re-ordering of multi-line plot elements when replotting.

2012-08-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* lisp/gnuplot.el: elisp is now getting serious about a syntax change
	announced 10+ years ago.   s/(` (/`(/
	While here, clean out some old cruft from the directory.

2012-08-07  Mojca Miklavec <mojca.miklavec.lists@gmail.com>

	* term/aquaterm.trm:  Revised test for transparency support to match
	the implementation in AquaTerm version 1.1.1

2012-08-07  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c src/datafile.h src/plot2d.c src/tabulate.c:
	Blank lines separating datasets in an input file were stored as an
	UNDEFINED point but not otherwise marked. This patch introduces a
	recognizable (struct coordinate)blank_data_line that is stored when
	a blank line is encounted. This means that when writing the data back
	out via "set table" the separation between data sets can be maintained.
	Bug #3553151

2012-08-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/command.c src/command.h src/eval.c
	src/eval.h src/graphics.c src/mouse.c src/parse.c src/parse.h
	src/plot2d.c src/save.c src/set.c src/show.c src/tables.c src/tables.h
	src/unset.c term/canvas.trm:

	New command and functionality
	   set link [x2|y2] {via <expression1> inverse <expression2>}
	   unset link [x2|y2]
	This ties the range on the secondary axis to that of the primary axis.
	<expression1> maps the primary axis coordinates onto the secondary axis.
	<expression2> maps the secondary axis coordinates onto the primary axis.
	The optional mapping can be nonlinear. If x2/y2 tics are auto-generated,
	they will be labeled in the transformed coordinate system.
	Mouse tracking readout will also report the transformed coordinates.

	Note: Making the "linked_to_primary" option generic introduces compiler
	warnings from the code handling the colorbar axis, which in reality can
	never be linked.  These will be removed in a subsequent patchset.

 	* demo/TaBr.dem docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Documentation and demo files for the new command.

	* config/Makefile.am config/Makefile.in src/Makefile.am src/Makefile.in 
 	src/Makefile.maint src/os9.c: Remove mention of os9.c from Makefiles and
	remove os9.c itself from the distribution.

2012-08-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h (STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE):  The fix of 
	2012-07-27 was not quite right (e.g. it broke electron.dem).

2012-08-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/pslatex.trm (EPSLATEX_set_color):  Some cairolatex set_color
	requests were being incorrectly ignored.
	Bug #3553940

	* src/plot2d.c:  Use coord_type rather than int where appropriate.

2012-08-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/canvas.trm term/svg.trm: Since we now support time to
	millisecond precision, the bounds of a time/date axis need to be
	written out using %.3f rather than %g.
	Bug #3548932

	* src/misc.c (load_file): The multiline bracketed clause handling adds
	trailing newlines to the input.  It is essential to check and extend the
	input buffer if needed before doing this.
	Bug #3549386

2012-07-27  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h (STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE):  Auto-generated data was
	failing to plot the first and last points if the corresponding axis 
	range was inverted. E.g. plot [10:-10] '+' using 1:(sinc($1)) with lines
	The incorrect range check was introduced in the patch of 2012-03-09.
	Bugfix.

2012-07-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graphics.c (attach_title_to_plot): Limit "title at end" placement
	to the INRANGE portion of a plot.

2012-07-24  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c (drawgraph):  Always use GDI calls only for
	printing. Do not mix with GDI+. This fixes printing of (transparent)
	filled polygons and boxes. Check if the printer driver can actually do
	transparency (AlphaBlend).
	See bug #3503318

2012-07-24  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/standard.c (f_asin, f_asinh): The patch of March 2011 got the
	overall sign wrong in the (x == 0.0) case.
	Bug #3542862

2012-07-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/js/gnuplot_mouse.js (mouse_update):  Allow for the possibility
	of mapping the x2 and y2 axis coordinates through plot-specific mapping
	functions gnuplot.x2_mapping(), gnuplot.y2_mapping() defined elsewhere.

2012-07-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/standard.c (f_acos): acos(x) was returning the complex conjugate
	of the correct result for complex input x with imag(x) > 0.
	Bug #3542862

	* src/parse.c (set_up_columnheader_parsing):  Take the column header 
	from the second using spec (normally the Y coordinate) to satisfy
	set key autotitle columnhead;  plot 'data' using "X":"Y"
	Bug #3542065

	* src/datafile.c (plot_option_using):  Track the appropriate column
	header when the column is specified via a non-string variable; e.g.
	plot for [i=1:N] 'data' using 1:(column(i))
	Bug #3542065

2012-07-18  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* term/win.trm (WIN_options): Specifying only the font size (ie. ",8")
	would overwrite the font name with a bogus string. Bug fix.

	* config/config.oww config/config.nt config/config.mgw
	config/makefile.cyg config/makefile.unx config/cygwin/Makefile
	config/mingw/Makefile config/msvc/Makefile config/watcom/Makefile
	src/command.c src/winmain.c:

	* src/win/wgnuplot.hpj: Removed.

2012-07-17  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/hidden3d.c (draw_edge): Fix broken tracking of top/bottom color
	distinction in hidden3d plots when the line colors are not specified in
	palette or RGB mode.
	Bugfix

2012-07-07  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/command.c (undefine_command): Allow "undefine $datablockname".

2012-07-07  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* config/mingw/Makefile:  Extend use of VPATH which makes some explicit
	rules superfluous. Automatically create dependency .d files during
	build. Include current date in filenames of zip-file and installer for
	non-release builds. Remove long-unused WINDOWS variable.

2012-07-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp (wheelEvent)
	src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (OnMouseWheel):

2012-07-05  Thomas Orgis  <sobukus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotApplication.cpp src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:
	The wxt and qt terminals handle -persist by continuing execution of a
	forked thread after the main thread has exited.  However, anyone waiting
	on the main thread won't see it as finished unless the stdout and 
	stderr streams inherited by the continuing process are closed.
	Bug #3309277

2012-07-04  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/pm3d.c (z2cb):  After "set log cb", z2cb(x) was returning 0 for
	x<=0 rather than -inf.  This causes it to be mistaken for the logged
	value of x=1.  Now we return CB_AXIS.min instead.
	Bug #3540048

2012-07-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graph3d.c src/plot3d.c: do_3dplot() was called in three places,
	but only one correctly wrapped it in splot_map_{de}active().
	Move the activate/deactivate calls inside do_3dplot().
	Bug #3539459

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp: Set Z value of zoom box to a large
	value so that it is not occluded by plot elements.

	* src/datafile.c (df_readascii): If the first line in a data file 
	contains column headers (strings to be used as titles), then that line
	should be ignored when applying the "plot ... every N:M(:N1:M1)" filter.
	Bug #3438848

2012-06-30  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/grpicon.ico:  Icon with more color depths and resolutions,

	Bug #3519079

	* term/canvas.trm: ctx.fillText() uses fillStyle rather than strokeStyle

	* src/graphics.h src/graph3d.h src/graphics.c src/plot2d.c:
	New modifier for the `title` keyword in plot commands.
	`title ... at {beginning|end}` writes the plot title on the graph
	itself, immediately next to the corresponding plot. This is independent
	of the normal key.

	* docs/gnuplog.doc demo/nokey.dem demo/all.dem:
	Document new option and provide a demo.

2012-06-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

2012-06-15  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc: Cleaned blank-only lines.

	* docs/Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	* docs/Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): allterm.h belongs here.
	(doc2ms_DEPENDENCIES, doc2tex_DEPENDENDIES)
	(alldoc2gih_DEPENDENCIES): Removed allterm.h from these, since
	that would only cause it to be built at link time, which is too
	late.
	(check-local): Renamed from check, which would collide with
	automake's own definition.  Add missing $(EXEEXT) and ./
	(termdoc.$(OBJEXT)): Removed explicit dependency, since it would
	have made exactly the wrong builds depend on allterm.h.

2012-06-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* docs/Makefile.am: autoconf (2.68) does not automatically
	propagate dependencies for allterm.h. Add generic dependencies as
	documented, even though this still results in incorrect
	ordering. Fix it empirically by adding an explicit lower-level
	dependency at the end of the file.

2012-06-14  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* docs/Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	* docs/Makefile.am (gnuplot.ms, figures, gnuplot.tex)
	(gnuplot.hlp, gnuplot.gih, allgih, wxhelp/wgnuplot.html)
	(gnuplot.ipf, gnuplot.rtf, gnuplot.rnh): Targets running private
	executables lacked mandatory $(EXEEXT).  Caused direct build of,
	e.g. 'make pdf', to try and build the wrong program and fail.

	src/unset.c src/plot3d.c src/gp_types.h src/tables.c src/graphics.c
	docs/gnuplot.doc:

	New command keywords "set surface {implicit|explicit}".
	Until now, splot has always added isolines to generate a gridded surface
	if an input data file looks like it contains lines along one direction
	of the grid.  This behavior corresponds to the "implicit" keyword and
	remains the default.  "set surface explicit" turns off the automatic
	generation of isolines, allowing such a data file to be plotted purely
	as unconnected lines rather than a generated grid.  You can still
	generate a gridded surface in this case by saying
	"plot ... with surface" rather than "plot ... with lines".

	Addresses tracker item #1244775 (Theo Hopman)

2012-06-13  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* config/config.mgw config/config.nt src/win/wtext.h:  Move preprocessor

	* config/mingw/Makefile config/msvc/Makefile:  Include
	templates for initialization files in distribution.

	* src/win/wgraph.c (drawgraph): Do not try to detect color capabilities
	of printers. When drawing to a printer, scale line widths to match the

	Bug #3503318

2012-06-12  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_readascii):  Bugfix for label plots using column 0
	to generate text. E.g. plot foo using 1:2:(sprintf("%d",$0)) with labels

2012-06-09  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/fit.c (setvar):  Accept a double value instead of struct value.
	Use fill_gpval_float. Simplify callers.

	* src/fit.c (getivar, getdvar, creatdvar):  Use get_udv_by_name() or
	add_udv_by_name().

	* src/fit.c (fit_command):  Always initialize variables which might be
	set by user variables. This is necessary since user variables may be
	`undefine`d.

	* src/eval.c (real_int):  New function to retrieve an integer value
	from a user variable.

2012-06-07  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/tabulate.c:  Allow tabulation (set table) of pixel values for
	IMAGE RGBIMAGE RGBA_IMAGE.

2012-06-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c (box_range_fiddling):
	Autoscaling + auto-boxwidth + log scale on x = fail.
	Bug #3529285

2012-05-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/pslatex.trm: More helpful error message if output filename
	is not acceptable.
	Bug #3529832

	* src/interpol.c (cp_implode): This routine was not preserving the z
	value (used as a weight by smooth acsplines) of input data points.
	Bug #3529621

	* src/plot2d.c (get_data) docs/gnuplot.doc:  Use unit weights for
	"smooth acsplines" if no separate column of weights is provided.

2012-05-25  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* docs/Makefile.am (gnuplot.ms, figures, gnuplot.tex)
	(gnuplot.hlp, gnuplot.gih, allgih, gnuplot.texi, gnuplot.ipf)
	(gnuplot.rtf, check): Re-enable out-of-source-tree builds.
	(doc2ms_SOURCES): Remove duplicate source file.
	(doc2ms): Remove rule that would conflict with automake generated
	one.

2012-05-24  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c: Recreate fonts after resizing the graph window.
	Fixes side effects of changes on 2012-05-20.

2012-05-23  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c src/win/wgnuplib.h term/win.trm: Support for
	hypertext labels for win terminal.

	* src/win/wgdiplus.c|h src/wgraph.c term/win.trm: rgba colors.
	Restricted to GDI+ and thus currently only available when using
	antialiasing.

2012-05-21  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term_api.h: Core support for hypertext in interactive
	terminals.  Terminal entry term->hypertext(int TYPE, const char
	TEXT) associates a hypertext string with some subsequent graphics
	object.  The effect of this association depends on TYPE.
	Initially only type HYPERTEXT_TOOLTIP is implemented.  This causes
	the text string to be displayed in a tooltip-like popup when the
	mouse hovers over the associated graphics element.

	* src/gadgets.c src/gadgets.h src/set.c src/show.c: New keyword
	"hypertext" associated with individual labels, including plot
	style "with labels".  The label text is displayed only when the
	mouse hovers over the associated anchor point.

	* term/README docs/gnuplot.doc demo/hypertext.dem: Documentation
	and demo

	* term/canvas.trm term/js/gnuplot_mouse.js: Support for canvas
	terminal.

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.h
	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.h
	src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp src/qtterminal/qt_term.h term/qt.trm:
	Support for qt terminal.

	* term/svg.trm term/js/gnuplot_svg.js: Support for svg terminal.

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.h
	src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.h
	src/wxterminal/wxt_term.h term/cairo.trm term/wxt.trm: Support for
	wxt terminal.

2012-05-20  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in docs/Makefile.am: Updated a patch from Christoph
	Junghans to use autoconf to manage the documentation subdirectory.
	The primary reason is to allow --without-lisp-files to control
	whether or not the build process tries to access emacs-specific
	directories and files that may not be present.  Bugs #2950671
	#3528377

2012-05-20  Alexander Täschner  <taschna@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/fit.c|h (regress)
	* src/save.c (save_set_all)
	* src/set.c (set_fit)
	* src/show.c (show_fit)
	* src/unset.c (unset_fit)
	* docs/gnuplot.doc: New option "set fit [no]errorscaling" which
	allows to toggle scaling of parameter errors. The default remains
	to scale errors.  Patch #3375473, Feature Request #2956524.

2012-05-20  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/wcommon.h src/win/wgnuplib.h src/win/wgraph.c: Remove
	limit on number of plots which can be toggled on/off via key
	entries.  Maximum number of toolbar buttons still restricted to
	MAXPLOTSHIDE.  Bug #3516417

	* demo/image2.dem: Meaning of "set [xyz]range reverse" changed.

	* term/win.trm (WIN_options, WIN_set_color) src/win/wgraph.c
	(drawgraph): Change the behaviour of the "mono" terminal option of
	the windows terminal. Colors are converted from RGB to grayscale in
	drawgraph(). That way, a grayscale copy of colour plots can be
	obtained more easily.

	* src/win/wgnuplib.h src/win/wgraph.c: Retain the temporary bitmap used
	for drawing to speed up redraws. Reduces the number of calls to
	drawgraph() to a minimum.

2012-05-17  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (do_arc) src/graphics.c (do_ellipse):  Revisit clipping the
	filled interior of circles and ellipses.  Now it handles objects whose
	center is outside the plot but specified in plot coordinates.
	Bug #3522515

2012-05-17  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	* docs/faq-ja.tex docs/gnuplot-ja.doc docs/term-ja.diff

2012-05-13  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (do_arc) src/graphics.c (do_ellipse):  Clip the filled
	interior of circles and ellipses.
	Bug #3522515

2012-05-11  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (wxt_cairo_refresh):  Execution of the
	command list must be protected by command_list_mutex or it will blow up
	if the command list is cleared/replaced during execution.
	Bug #3371205

	* src/graphics.c:  Allow log-scaled y axis for plots with fillsteps.
	Bug #3324785

2012-05-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (lf_push lf_pop) src/misc.h:  The lf_push/lf_pop mechanism
	for restoring context after a "call" statement was saving the individual
	call args $0 $1 etc, but failing to save the number of active args.
	Bug #3525155

2012-05-09  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (plot_option_array): Skip call to clear_binary_records.
	This reduces the order-dependence of binary plot options, but may intro-
	duce some persistence of options across plot commands.
	Bug #3408082

2012-05-07  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/cairo.trm term/pslatex.trm: Fix 'set term cairolatex pdf mono'
	Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/668339

	* src/graph3d.c (key_sample_line_pm3d key_sample_point_pm3d):
	If the color scheme is "lc variable", take the color of key sample from
	the first point in the data set.

2012-05-06  Anton Gladky <gladky.anton@gmail.com>

	* src/command.c: Fix segfault in initial check of history when using
	--with-readline=bsd
	Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/665832

	* src/plot.c: EAM - avoid calling buggy libedit emulation of
	using_history().
	Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/598547

2012-05-05  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c term/estimate.trm:  Rename utf8_strlen to utf8_strwidth
	to avoid name collision.

	* src/internal.c (f_strlen f_range) src/util.c (strlen_utf8 gp_strlen)
	(utf8_strchrn gp_strchrn) src/util.h:  Fix gnuplot's user-visible
	string handling routines strlen() and substr() so that they handle
	multibyte UTF-8 characters correctly.  I.e. strlen() returns the number
	of characters, not the number of bytes.  Other multi-byte encodings are
	not handled, however.
	Bug #3480075

2012-05-04  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* CodeStyle config/Makefile.am.in configure.in demo/Makefile.am.in
	 lisp/Makefile.am m4/Makefile.am.in Makefile.am man/Makefile.am
	 share/LaTeX/Makefile.am share/Makefile.am src/Makefile.am
	 src/qtterminal/Makefile.am src/version.c src/wxterminal/Makefile.am
	 term/Makefile.am.in tutorial/Makefile.am.in:

	 Automake 1.12 removes support for the AM_C_PROTOTYPES macro and for
	 conversion of ANSI C code to K&R C code.  Gnuplot's CodeStyle file has
	 warned since version 3.7 that gnuplot would drop support for ansi2knr
	 "very soon".  Now 12+ years later the other shoe has dropped.
	 
	 This set of changes removes reference to AM_C_PROTOTYPES and ansi2knr
	 in the autoconf files, replacing it with an unconditional
	 AC_DEFINE(PROTOTYPES,1) so that the existing source code stays happy.
	 The individual config.* files and the source code itself can be cleaned
	 up later to remove the need for this definition.

	* src/ansi2knr.1 src/ansi2knr.c src/ansichek.h: Remove these.

	* src/set.c(set_command) src/command.c(do_command):  Test for empty
	iteration loop in "set for ..." and "do for ..." commands.

2012-05-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/js/canvasmath.js term/js/gnuplot_common.js term/js/gnuplot_svg.js
	term/js/gnuplot_dashedlines.js term/js/gnuplot_mouse.js:
	Reduce the scope of local variables.

2012-05-02  Arun Persaud  <arun@nubati.net>

	* term/svg.trm:  Remove trailing whitespace from output svg files.

2012-05-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_readascii):  CHANGE long-standing program action to
	check every input data line individually for number of data columns.
	Instead, whatever number of columns are found in the first record, that
	same number is expected for the rest of the input file.
	This is not ideal, because plot 'foo' with points will now fail if 'foo'
	has 4 or more entries on the first line but only 3 on subsequent lines.
	On the other hand, it fixes the unexpected behavior that
	    3 NaN
	in record 5, for example, would be treated as (5,3) DEFINED
	rather than as (3,NaN) UNDEFINED.

	* docs/gnuplot.doc docs/figure_missing.pdf:  Documentation and example
	for above change.

2012-04-30  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (do_arc):  A bug in the new wedge/nowedge option left a
	gap in the perimeter of some circles.
	Bug #3522503

	* term/wxt.trm:  Add a linewidth option to the wxt terminal.

2012-04-27  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/svg.trm:  Prevent illegal characters from being generated as 
	subplot ids if there are more than 30 subplots in a multiplot.

2012-04-26  Jon Oddie  <joddie@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docs/doc2texi.c: Two bug fixes
	Cleaner code to determine which term files to read in d2t-get-terminals.
	Fix code for uniquifying duplicate node names.

	* configure.in docs/Makefile.in docs/doc2texi.c:
	Create an Emacs Lisp file of documentation strings extracted from the
	syntax descriptions in gnuplot.doc. Gnuplot-mode can then optionally
	display these strings as automatic one-line documentation while editing,
	and pop up the full syntax description on request

2012-04-26  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/svg.trm:  Write out coordinates to the precision implied by
	SVG_SCALE.

	* src/set.c: Fix incorrect test for error return from iconv().

2012-04-24  Mojca Miklavec <mojca.miklavec.lists@gmail.com>

	* term/aquaterm.trm:  Clip images to bounding box. Reset line type
	at the start of each plot.

2012-04-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in m4/apple.m4:  Add a configuration option for aquaterm.
	The default is --without-aquaterm, select using --with-aquaterm.

2012-04-20  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/aquaterm.trm: rgba colors

2012-04-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/js/canvasmath.js (measure): Correct width of composite characters

	* term/svg.trm: The svg code refers to CANVAS_OVERSAMPLE when it should
	refer to SVG_SCALE.  Fortunately they both equal 10.

2012-04-17  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (load_file):  If the input file did not end in a newline,
	the test for balanced {} occurred too early, causing a false error if
	the final partial line did in fact contain the required }.
	Bug #3518476

	* src/command.c src/datafile.c src/graph3d.c src/graphics.c
	src/hidden3d.c src/mouse.c src/util3d.c:
	Remove dead code.

	* config/config.nt config/config.os2 config/config.oww config/config.mgw
	config/config.cyg config/config.dj2 config/config.wc src/parse.c
	src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c src/show.c src/eval.c src/set.c:
	Remove the --enable-backwards-compatibility configuration option.
	The deprecation warning has been in the documentation since version 4.0
	and it wasn't working in recent versions anyhow.

2012-04-12  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* configure.in term/gd.trm:  We no longer claim to support libgd 
	versions older than 2.0

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Clear out the New Features section, which should
	now cover stuff added since 4.6

	* src/color.c (set_rgbcolor) src/color.h src/graph3d.c src/hidden3d.c:
	In order to read and store a 32-bit AlphaRGB value it must be treated
	as (unsigned int) rather than (int).

	* term/cairo.trm term/canvas.trm term/gd.trm term/svg.trm 
	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp
	src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.h
	src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp demo/rgba_lines.dem:
	Carry along all 32 bits of an input RGB value, so that the high bits
	can hold an alpha channel.  In order for existing RGB colors to stay
	opaque, this means that alpha=0 is opaque and alpha=255 is transparent.
	>>> Note: this convention is the inverse of the current treatment
	>>>       of the alpha channel in "with rgbimage".

2012-04-10  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.c (df_readbinary):  NaN treatment tested the wrong flag
	(df_matrix_file rather than df_matrix).

2012-04-08  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/misc.c (iso_alloc iso_extend):  Initialize each 3D coordinate
	structure on allocation.  Fixes problems found by valgrind and easily
	seen by running imageNaN.dem.

	* src/datafile.c src/graphics.c demo/imageNaN.dem demo/all.dem:
	Revised treatment of NaN in the input data stream.
	1) Mark NaN points as DF_UNDEFINED on input. This is a CHANGE. Ascii NaN
	was either reported as DF_BAD or ignored altogether depended on context;
	binary NaN was not handled at all, leading to possible segfaults.
	2) Treat NaN in non-coordinate data columns in the same way as NaN in a
	coordinate.
	Bug #3513138 and various problems visible by running imageNaN.dem

2012-04-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c (copy_or_invent_formatstring):  Expansion to many decimal
	places of precision is not necessary if the axis range spans 0, because
	in that case exponential notation can be used instead.
	Bug #3514604

2012-04-01  Hannes Nagel  <hannes.nagel@itp.uni-leipzig.de>

	* term/lua.term: Do not create external png images if they are not 
	going to be used in the tex document.

2012-04-01  Jérôme Lodewyck  <lodewyck@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWidget.h src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotWidget.cpp:

	turn on text antialiasing

2012-03-31  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/pm3d.c term/post.trm term/pslatex.trm src/term_api.h src/color.c:
	The core code should not write terminal-specific output.  Instead define
	TERM_LAYER_BEGIN_PM3D_MAP and TERM_LAYER_END_PM3D_MAP and use the 
	term->layer() mechanism.  This prevents garbage from being written out
	to the cairolatex terminals in pm3d mode.
	Bug #3513291

2012-03-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/wxterminal/gp_cairo.c (gp_cairo_draw_polygon): Always stroke

	Bug #3512955

2012-03-26  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term.c (enhanced_recursion): Revised handling of backslash

2012-03-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/js/canvasmath.js:  Handle tab and newline.

2012-03-20  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c src/plot2d.h:  Allow variable pointsize in label plots.

	* term/canvas.trm:  Push the correction for over-sampling of Pt
	coordinates down one level so it matches the other graphics item types.

	* src/unset.c:  "reset" must clear range_is_reverted flag for all axes.

2012-03-18  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.c (gen_tics): Be even more paranoid about precision error in
	axis range or tic steps.

	* src/set.c: Sanity checking on requested number of minitic intervals.

2012-03-18  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/gplt_x11.c (exec_cmd): Don't feed unknown strings directly

2012-03-16  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/post.trm term/svg.trm:
	Do not allow execution of popen() commands during initialization.

	* src/gadgets.h src/graphics.c src/save.c src/set.c src/show.c
	src/term.c src/term_api.h docs/gnuplot.doc:
	New option "set style circle {no}wedges"

2012-03-13  Michael Reeves  <mgreeves@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/graphics.c: Improved calculation of the margin space needed to
	hold rotated x and x2 tic labels.
	Bug #3482491

2012-03-12 Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* win/gnuplot.iss: Bump version number of installer to 4.7.

	* config/mingw/Makefile: New target 'zip' for zip file distribution.

2012-03-09  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/axis.h src/graphics3d.c src/util3d.c:
	Preparatory cleanup for re-working of axis reverse and range check
	processing.  This change reduces the size of code produced by macro 
	STORE_WITH_LOG_AND_UPDATE_RANGE (called >50 times)
	but does not change the runtime behavior of the program.

	* src/axis.c src/axis.h src/command.c src/gadgets.h src/mouse.c 
	src/mouse.h src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c src/save.c src/set.c src/unset.c
	docs/gnuplot.doc:
	Change the handling of "set [xyz]range reverse".
	Get rid of flag RANGE_REVERSE.  Axis range endpoints are now always
	stored as-is (i.e. XAXIS.min is not guaranteed to be numerically less
	than XAXIS.max).  The user command "set [xyz]range ... reverse" now
	only affects auto-scaling. This is a change in behavior, although it
	matches what the documentation has always given as the intended use.
	Fixes various bugs and unexpected behavior; e.g.
	"set xr [1:0]; set xr [0:1];" left the axis range reversed.

2012-03-09  BUMP DEVELOPMENT VERSION NUMBER TO 4.7

2012-03-09  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

2012-03-03  Petr Mikulik  <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* docs/doc2ipf.c (process_line): Don't use assert() because it calls
	int_error().

2012-03-02  Petr Mikulik  <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* config/makefile.os2: version.o is required for gnuplot_x11.exe.

2012-03-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc:  Point to www.gnuplot.info as the URL for all demos.
	
	* configure.in src/plot.c src/version.c src/show.c config/mingw/Makefile:
	Mark this explicitly as a DEVELOPMENT_VERSION at configuration time
	rather than hiding or providing a RELEASE_VERSION definition in
	individual source files.

	* src/command.c src/misc.c src/plot.c src/plot.h:
	Unterminated blocks (i.e. missing }) in batch mode caused the program to

	through a pipe - crash. Fix: display an appropriate error message instead.
	Bug #3491904

2012-02-22  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	Bug #3488666

2012-02-14  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot2d.c src/graphics.c:  The histogram code was not designed to 
	mix well with other plot styles, and in particular with function plots.
	Fixes segfault on "plot 1, newhistogram illegal-syntax, foo".
	Fixes Bug #3486639 (key entry spacing of histograms + something else)

	not characters.

2012-01-21  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/datafile.h src/datafile.c src/plot2d.c src/breaders.c src/plot3d.c

	name in addition to the current line number.

	* term/wxt.trm src/term_api.h src/term.c src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp
	src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp:  Switching the terminal from qt to wxt or
	vice versa causes the program to lock up or segfault.  Introduce a flag

	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.h src/qtterminal/gnuplot_qt.cpp
	src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp term/qt.trm: The Qt terminal application is
	executed in a separate executable called gnuplot_qt, started by exec.
	This makes the Qt terminal compatible with OS X.

2012-01-17  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/eval.c (update_plot_bounds):  Store the canvas size used by
	the previous plot in user accessible variables GPVAL_TERM_XSIZE,

	* win/gnuplot.iss: Japanese translation

2012-01-11  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/util3d.h src/util3d.c (edge3d_intersect two_edge3d_intersect) 
	src/graph3d.c (plot3d_lines_pm3d):  The utility routines in util3d
	assumed that a 3D curve is always traversed in ascending order of the
	constituent points.  But plot3d_lines_pm3d scans in both directions,
	leading to incorrect clipping and possible array over-run when the
	utility routines were called.  Furthermore, the arrays holding the
	scan direction info were never initialized.
	Bug #3471163

2012-01-09  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* docs/Makefile.in src/term.h src/makefile.awc src/Makefile.all

	* configure.in src/Makefile.am: Tweak autodetection of Qt utilities to
	handle differences in the Qt 4.6 and 4.7 pkg-config files.

	* src/set.c: Call gp_expand_tilde() in 'set loadpath' and 'set fontpath'.

2012-01-04  Colin Macdonald  <macdonald@maths.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/gplt_x11.c: Set WM_CLASS to "Gnuplot" for the benefit of various
	window managers.

2012-01-04  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/hidden3d.c: Fix an uninitialized colorspec found by valgrind.
	The trigger was hidden3d handling of '... with labels tc palette'.

2012-01-02  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc src/graphics.c:  Establish a documented clipping
	behavior for rectangles - clip to fit in the graph unless one or both
	corners are given in screen coordinates.

2012-01-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotApplication.cpp (processEvent):
	* src/wxterminal/wxt_gui.cpp (wxt_atexit):
	In "persist" mode, if all qt plot windows were already closed when the
	main program exited then the daughter process would become a zombie.
	Even worse for wxt; if _any_ plot windows had been closed then the 
	persisting daughter process would become a zombie.
	Bugfix.

2011-12-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/plot.c src/plot.h src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp:
	Provide a function cancel_history() that can be called by terminal
	helper functions after forking so that the history file isn't 
	trashed on exit.
	Bug #2950711

2011-12-28  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.h src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotItems.cpp
 	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotItems.h src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp
 	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.h src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp term/qt.trm:

	Organize Qt display list items into groups, one group per plot.
	Track display area of keybox entries so that mouse clicks there can
	toggle the visibility of the corresponding plot group.
	NB: Doesn't work if the key box is set to opaque.

	* src/plot.c src/show.c: More compact splash page.

	* configure.in: Default to --enable-stats --without-bitmap-terminals

	* Remove obsolete interface shim intergraph.x11

	* src/graphics.c src/graphics.h src/graph3d.c:
	Strangely, the final parameter of place_objects(,,,clip_area) was
	(1) never used and (2) shadowed a global parameter that _was_ used.
	Bug #3426247

2011-12-25  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotEvent.cpp src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp:
	If two button release events occur in quick succession then the program
	messes up the event handling and winds up in a non-recoverable state.
	Apply an empirical fix to ignore events in a 300 msec window.
	Also rather than ending up a zombie, exit explicitly on a sync error.
	Bugfix

2011-12-23  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	Miscellaneous documentation updates, remove dead URLs.

	* configure.in docs/gnuplot.doc src/plot.c src/show.c
	config/config.cyg config/config.dj2 config/config.mgw config/config.nt
	config/config.os2 config/config.oww config/makefile.unx:

	Despite what it says in the documentation, and despite what the
	configure script prints out, auto-configuration never defined the
	NOCWDRC flag to disable reading an initialization file .gnuplot
	from the current directory.  This is a security risk.  Furthermore,
	having to define something special to get the secure state is bad
	design.  Fix the configuration script and default to not initializing
	from the current directory.  Put a warning in various config files.

2011-12-07  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* demo/random.dem: Use loops to create random number data sets.

	every pipe and read and write pipes are supported.

2011-12-05  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* src/win/winmain.c: Automatic language detection can be overridden
	by new setting "Language=XX" in wgnuplot.ini. Suggestion by Shigeharu
	Takeno.

2011-12-03  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/gadgets.h src/set.c src/show.c src/graph3d.c src/graphics.c
	src/save.c docs/gnuplot.doc: Add an arrow specification syntax variant
	    "set arrow <tag> from <position> length <val> angle <angle>"
	that makes it easy to describe arrows of constant length, independent of
	terminal or graph aspect ratios and 3D view angle.

2011-12-01  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/graph3d.c (draw_3d_graphbox): Rather than treating the position
	of the z-axis label as a fixed 3D [x,y,z], always draw it at a fixed
	distance to the left of the z axis.  This is a CHANGE in behavior.
	Bug #2879916

2011-11-29  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotItems.cpp src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotItems.h
	src/qtterminal/QtGnuplotScene.cpp src/qtterminal/qt_term.cpp
	term/qt.trm configure.in:
	- Pointsize is a double, not an integer (fractional sizes were being
	  truncated to zero).
	- When a polygon is flushed, the final vertex must be kept as the
	  current position. Bug #3370540.
	- The default rendering ("native") is pathetically slow for polygons.
	  If the Qt version is >= 4.7 this can be changed using environmental
	  variable QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM.  Otherwise we force it to "raster".

2011-11-29  Shigeharu Takeno  <shige@iee.niit.ac.jp>

	Bug #3441395

	* src/set.c (set_autoscale_axis): Remove unjustifiably large macros.

2011-11-26  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* term/cairo.trm: Revert the change of 2011-08-25 that tried to skip 
	empty vectors. The concept was sound but the implementation was not
	correct, leading to mysteriously missing lines.
	Bugfix.

2011-11-26  Bastian Maerkisch  <bmaerkisch@web.de>

	* config/mingw/Makefile: Support building of the Japanese help file
	wgnuplot-ja.chm.

	directory separator.

	* src/eval.c (update_gpval_variables): New variable GPVAL_ENCODING.

	* term/gd.trm (gd_iconv): Silence const mismatch compiler warning
	in call to iconv by casting second argument to (void *).

	term/svg.trm demo/world.dem docs/gnuplot.doc:

	New coordinate mode for geographic (DMS) data axes. 
	`set xdata geographic` indicates that the x coordinate is to be
	interpreted as a geographic coordinate measured in degrees.
	Use `set format x` to establish how the coordinate appears as an axis
	tick label. Similarly for the y axis.

2011-11-24  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>

	* src/term_api.h src/misc.c src/hidden3d.c:  New flag LT_SINGLECOLOR
	passed through to hidden3d to indicate that the user gave an explicit
	surface color in the splot command.
	Bugfix.

2011-11-22  Ethan A Merritt  <merritt@u.washington.edu>
