	* src/save.c: set linestyle --> set style line

2000-10-27  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* term/pstricks.trm (PSTRICKS_xscale): removed, as it was
	essentially unused, anyway.
	(PSTRICKS_yscale): dito.
	(PSTRICKS_graphics): respect 'size' and 'offset' settings in
	creating the bounding box of the graph.

	* term/eepic.trm (EEPIC_lines): Added a few more linetypes which
 	had been blissfully commented out.
	(EEPIC_NUMLINES): raised to 10, accordingly.
	(EEPIC_graphics): respect 'size' and 'offset' settings in creating
 	the bounding box of the graph. This overrides the patch of
 	2000-10-24 filed in by Lars.

2000-10-25  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc: added documentation for the "history" and 
	  "system" commands.

2000-10-25  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* src/pm3d.c, src/color.[ch]:
	repaired supplying of extended color specs in pm3d
	(make it working in vgagl.trm)

2000-10-24  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* trm/post.trm: "g" makes stroke + set(gray/rgb), "G" and "H" removed;
	  finally supporting 'with l lt pal' too

	* docs/gnuplot.doc, pm3d/README: say PM3D works under Win too

2000-10-24  Lars Hecking  <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>

	* docs/gnuplot.texi: Regenerate to include new arrow heads options
	and driver updates.

2000-10-24  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/win/wgraph.c (WndGraphProc): ported X11/OS2 feature that
 	pressing SPC in graph window transfers the focus to the gnuplot
 	text window.

2000-10-24  Lars Hecking  <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>

	* missing: Update from automake-cvs.

	* src/depcomp: Add from automake-cvs.

	* term/cgm.trm(CGM_graphics): Use gnuplot_version instead of VERSION.
	Add gnuplot_patchlevel to description string.

	* term/cgm.trm(CGM_set_font): Eliminate compiler warning.

	* term/emf.trm: Update to latest version.

2000-10-24  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* term/ggi.trm: increased the speed of ggi command line
	input by redrawing ruler / statusline coordinates / zoombox
	only if they've changed.

	* term/ggi.trm: masking also key repeat events

	* term/ggi.trm: 'q' closes the terminal, so it's
	compatible with X11 and vgagl.

2000-10-24  Lars Hecking  <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>

	* missing: Update from automake-cvs.

	* src/depcomp: Add from automake-cvs.

	* term/cgm.trm: Use gnuplot_version and gnuplot_patchlevel instead of
	VERSION. Escape underscores in font names for TeX/LaTeX.

	* term/cgm.trm(CGM_set_font): Eliminate compiler warning.

	* term/emf.trm: Update to latest version.

	* term/ggi.trm: Delete empty line at end of termdocs section.

2000-10-24  Brendt Wohlberg  <brendt@cnls.lanl.gov>

	* term/pslatex.trm: The current pslatex term has an option for
	modifying the text font size, but this option only changes text
	positioning without actually changing the font size. This patch
	changes the optional value from a scaling factor to a font size
	(in points) and includes LaTeX commands to actually change the
	font size. 

2000-10-24  Andreas Czechanowski  <dl4sdc@dl4sdc.ampr.org>

	* term/fig.trm: Update to fig file format version 3.2. Fix scaling
	in metric mode. Change upper left corner offset to be at an integer
	centimeter position in metric mode. Output sizes for metrix are now
	12x8cm and 12x15cm.

2000-10-23  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* repaired `pm3d hidden'

2000-10-23  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* src/os2/gclient.c: support for 'with l lt pal'

2000-10-23  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* `linetype palette' linetype, e.g.:
	  - set style line 1 lt pal
	  - splot sin(sqrt(x*x+y*y))/sqrt(x*x+y*y) w l lt pal
	draws lines using a smooth palette which is set with the
	command `set palette'. This works only for splots and
	lines / points / dots (not impulses). It works also
	for contours. For normal surface plots, the scans are
	scan-wise depth-ordered. This is not perfect, but it's
	better than nothing and it's still pretty fast. If speed
	is not an issue, hidden3d can be used. Currently, the
	following terminals are supported:
	  - X11, gif, fig, vgagl, ggi

2000-10-22  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* repaired `gnuplot -rv' (src/gplt_x11.c) so that it takes
	white as foreground for border / text ...

	* `linetype palette' option: uses the smooth palette as
	specified by `set pal' (only possible for pm3d enhanced
	terminals). Works for splots:

	    lines
	    points
	    dots

	/not/ for impulses (would this make sense ?)
	Currently only implemented in the following terminals:

	    X11
	    gif
	    fig
	    vgagl
	    ggi

2000-10-22  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* ggi driver:
	  - event / mouse support
	  - multiplot support
	  - autoconf support
	  - mode selection support

2000-10-20  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* term/win.trm (WIN_make_palette): new function to implement PM3D
 	support for the Windows driver
	(WIN_set_color): dito
	(WIN_filled_polygon): dito

	* src/win/wgraph.c (drawgraph): add low-level parts of PM3D
 	implementation, here.

2000-10-20  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/win/wgnuplib.h (WGNUPLOTVERSION): bumped version number of
	wgnuplib interface to 1.3. That's the DLL version, in Win16
	builds.
	(LOGPEN) and some others: commented out some definitions no longer
	needed, for the MinGW32 build. The compiler's headers no provide
	them.
	(W_line_width): new message number, for implementing linewidth.
	(W_pm3d_setcolor), (W_pm3d_filled_polygon): new message numbers
	for PM3D support

	* src/win/winmain.c (MyVFPrintF): New function. vfprintf() was
	missing in the simulated <stdio.h> functions of the Windows text
	terminal emulation.

	* src/win/wtext.h: comment out 'dontuse_vfprintf', to allow the
	new vfprintf() to be used.

	* term/win.trm (WIN_linewidth): new function. Now you can use the
	'linewidth' option of gnuplot commands too, not just the
	Windows-specific method of globally changing the definition of
	linetypes.
	(WIN_last_linetype): new variable caching the linetype last set.
	(WIN_linetype): check against cached linetype, to avoid unneeded
	pen changes.
	(WIN_init): invalidate cache
	(WIN_graphics): invalidate cache

	* src/win/wgraph.c (MakePens): Create pens on-the-fly, rather than
	all in a bunch at plot start time. Needed to support dynmicaly
	changeable line widths.
	(DestroyPens): dito.
	(drawgraph): dito, plus the low-level side of the implementation
	of changeable linewidths.

2000-10-20  Alan Braslau  <braslau@drecam.saclay.cea.fr>

	* plot2d.c(print_table): Table terminal driver now produces
	x y [xlow xhigh] [ylow yhigh] type as per errorbar mode. The
	financebars and candlesticks types are not covered.

2000-10-20  David Mussomeli  <dado.sere@libero.it>

	* term/eepic.trm(EEPIC_graphics): Picture environment is now scaleable
	by the "set size" command.

2000-10-18  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/set.c (set_arrow): don't accept 'first' and 'second' as keywords
	before 'from' or 'to'.
	
2000-10-12  James R. Van Zandt  <jrv@vanzandt.mv.com>

	* term/cgm.trm (general): Initialize font table with the standard
	WebCGM fonts, plus the Hershey fonts, plus the other fonts
	implemented by the Microsoft Office import filter, plus a few
	variations (so "oblique" and "italic" are equivalent).  Default
	font is now "Helvetica Bold".  Use a struct array to hold the
	standard font names and their relative widths.  Add references
        to CGM documents, especially those on-line.  Defeat assertions
        by default.

	* term/cgm.crm (CGM_put_text): Was using the same distance as
	the the declared baseline-to-baseline text dimension (used by
	gnuplot) and the baseline-to-capline height declared in the
	output file.  Reducing the character height (by factor of 2/3)
	in the output file.  Increase default font size from 10 to 12
	pt to compensate.
	
	* term/cgm (CGM_set_font): Construct the CGM format font list on
	the fly.  Adjust the declared text width according to the
	dimensions of the chosen font. Handle the case where the input
        string does not include the font height.

	* term/cgm (CGM_options): If font isn't in table, add it
	(retaining the existing fonts).  Add "nofontlist" option which
	only omits the font list (no effect on color table).
	"winword6" is now just a deprecated synonym for "nofontlist".
	"solid" option was incorrectly setting cgm_dashed to TRUE.
	Fixed.  In "linewidth" option, part of sanity check was on
	cgm_linewidth instead of cgm_linewidth_pt.  Fixed.  User can
	specify line colors with option like "xff00dd".  User colors
	go into a separate table, which can grow automatically.

	* term/cgm (CGM_point): Implement open markers.

	* term/cgm (CGM_put_text): Eliminate duplicate elements in output
	file: Write text characteristics only if they have changed: font
	index, character height, justification mode.  Treat character
	orientation the same way.  

	* term/cgm (CGM_text_angle): generalize internal data
        structures to allow for text oriented at other angles than
        horizontal or vertical.

	* term/cgm (CGM_linecolor): Eliminate yellow as a line color (too
	hard to see against a white background).  Add orange and gray.

	* term/cgm (CGM_graphics): For MIL-D-28003A compliance: add
	gnuplot version and MIL-D-28003A reference to picture
	description, and write element list as the third element.
	Omit color table for monochrome file.  Add missing elements to
	metafile elements list: Color Value Extent, Font List, Color
	Table.  Add the new elements required for open markers: edge
	type, edge width, edge color, and edge visibility.  Omit VDC
	Integer Precision, Transparency, and Clip Indicator elements,
	since some import filter cannot digest them and we are using
	the defaults anyway.

	* term/cgm (CGM_linewidth): Flush polylines before changing
	linewidth.

	* term/cgm (help text): Document above changes.  Add notes
	about the Microsoft Office CGM input filter.  Rewrap some
	paragraphs to stay within the specified 73 columns.

2000-10-06  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* implemented finally configurable offsets for
	set label "xy" at x, y pointsize 1 offset 2.0, 3.0
	Useful for placing labels slightly offset from data
	points. This was one of the points left from implementing
	the mouse stuff.

2000-09-21  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>
	* src/graphics.c src/graph3d.c: bugfix "if ((*t->pointsize))"
	changed to "if (t->pointsize)

2000-09-20  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* relative arrows:
	  set arrow from start_x, start_y rto delta_x, delta_y
	* if front was given, the arrow head stuff wasn't applied.
	  I repaired this. (also for 3d plots).

2000-09-14  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* graphics.c (map_position), graph3d.c (map_position): Fix
 	off-by-one bug in treatment of term->{x,y}max when translating
 	'screen' coordinates.

2000-09-13  Daniel Luecking  <luecking@uark.edu>

	* term/metapost.trm: Disambiguated options m$onochrome and
	m$agnification. Changed %g to %f in output format (MPt doesn't know
	exponential notation). Changed MP_DPI from 300 to 2400.

2000-08-02  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>
	* src/graph3d.c src/graphics.c src/set.c src/show.c src/term.c
	  src/plot.h docs/gnuplot.doc term/fig.trm:
	allow setting arrow head(s) sizes --- new keywords `heads` and
	`{size <length>,<angle>}` for `set arrow`.
	Note: not implemented for TeX-like terminals, which draw arrows
	by their own method.

2000-07-25  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* src/graphics.c src/plot.c src/plot2d.c src/plot3d.c src/plot.h
	  src/graph3d.c src/os2/gclient.c term/pm.trm term/post.trm:
	avoid writing filenames in keys as enhanced text in enhanced-text
	capable terminals (postscript and Presentation Manager); i.e., don't 
	write file "a_123.dat" with '1' as subscript of 'a'.
	  The method used sets a new flag `this_plot->title_no_enhanced = 1;`
	if the title of filename or function cannot be enhanced. When keys are
	typeset, then new global global variable `ignore_enhanced_text` is set.
	Then enhanced terminals decide whether to use normal-text or
	enhanced-text writing method. 
	  Note: There was another method proposed to solve this problem: all
	escape characters to be backslashed on reading of the title. However,
	this would not work if the same plot is replotted subsequently on
	enhanced and non-enhanced terminals.

2000-07-13  Petr Mikulik  <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* pm3d: src/os2/gclient.c, term/pm.trm: bugfix for color palette
	allocation ('set palette maxcolors' was ignored)

2000-07-10  Petr Mikulik  <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* src/color.c: boundary around the color box is drawn by move&line
	for bitmap as well as postscript-including terminals.
	Contributed by Gregor Thalhammer <Gregor.Thalhammer@uibk.ac.at>

2000-06-24  Petr Mikulik  <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* src/color.c: if is_log_z, then print the non-logged values of z_min
	and z_max around the color box

	* src/unset.c: 'unset pm3d' sets the y axis to noreversed if the reversed
	has been set by 'set pm3d map'

	* pm3d: a trick for rotating the ylabel via 'set pm3d map' (see variable
	`pm3d_map_rotate_ylabel`). That's needed because gnuplot does not have an
	option for rotating x,y,z axes labels; once it possesses it, the above 
	mentioned variable would be replaced by the new one.

2000-06-23  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* src/gplt_x11.c: repaired `selection' (by left mouse).
	I really don't know when and how this got broken!

2000-06-20  Juha Takala  <juha.takala@vtt.fi>

	* gplt_x11.c: Add missing forward slash to path for .Xdefaults.

2000-06-15  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* term/cgm.trm(CGM_option): reject linewidth zero to avoid
	infinite looping in CGM_dashed_vector(), later

2000-06-14  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* epslatex.trm also for pm3d

2000-06-14  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* src/color.c: modified the postscript color box drawing for user borders
	* term/post.trm: repaired the broken pslatex if using `encoding'
	as proposed by Petr Mikulik.

2000-06-13  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/datafile.c(df_gets): prompt visibly for inline data, if
	in interactive mode.

	* src/set.c(reset_command): set grid linewidth to 1.0, like the
	startup value (was 0.5, incorrectly).

2000-06-10  Lars Hecking  <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>

	* GNUmakefile, Makefile.am: Move pre-dist target from Makefile.am.

	* configure.in: New --enable-epslatex option. Cleanups.

	* src/term.h: Add epslatex support.

	* term/ggi.trm: New GGI driver, contributed by Cesar Crusius
	<crusius@leland.stanford.edu>. Support not complete yet.

	* term/epslatex.trm: New terminal driver by Gregor Thalhammer
	<Gregor.Thalhammer@uibk.ac.at>, updated version from 7th June.

2000-06-09  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* src/save.c: don't close the fp's if it's stdout

2000-06-09  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* implemented the palette `origin', `size', `border',
	`noborder', `bdefault' subcommands and did a few changes
	for the placement of the labels at horizontal color boxes.

2000-06-04  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* included the supported terminals for pm3d to gnuplot.doc

2000-05-31  Petr Mikulik  <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>

	* Ignore `replot` command called from mouse/hotkey-event-enhanced
	terminal when some plot data were piped in gnuplot via stdin ---
	i.e., no mouse replot after `plot '-'`). See also "no replot after
	`plot '-'`" discussion in the gnuplot-beta newsgroup.
	New variables: plotted_data_from_stdin, replot_disabled.

2000-05-25  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>
	* pm3d: support for pm3d functionality in 'pslatex / pstex' terminals

2000-05-25  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>
	* pm3d: unset.c: #ifdef X11 .. #endif missing in unset_pm3d()

2000-05-24  Lars Hecking  <lhecking@nmrc.ie>

	* configure.in: configure should always exit with an exit code
	of zero.

	* pm3d/contrib: added pm3dConvertToImage.awk

2000-05-09  Petr Mikulik <mikulik@physics.muni.cz>
	* pm3d: three new color mapping formulae 34--36: 2x,2x-0.5,2x-1

2000-05-04  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* reimplemented the Linux vgagl terminal driver with
	mouse and pm3d support (uses the lib3dkit library)

2000-05-04  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* configure.in, src/plot.c, src/parse.c: replace setjmp by
	sigsetjmp and longjmp by siglongjmp if these functions
	(or macros) are available.

2000-05-04  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* src/command.c: always include ipc.h

	* term/linux.trm: typedef int in declaration of linux_line_func_ptr

	* term/x11.trm: added a few ifdef USE_MOUSE's to exclude mouse
	code, if compiling w/o mouse support.

2000-05-03  Johannes Zellner <johannes@zellner.org>

	* merged pre-pm3d - pre-pm3d-01 from the MAIN trunk.

2000-05-02  Lars Hecking  <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>

	* INSTALL: In "Platform notes" section, add hint for using

	function prototypes.

	* src/graphics.c(graph_error), src/graphics.h: Revert to non-variadic
	version, as graph_error() tries to pass a variable number of arguments
	into another variadic function. Noted by Pieter-Tjerk de Boer.

	* src/mouse.c: Formatting, indentation, RCS id.

	* src/plot3d.h: Add external variable declaration.

	* src/graph3d.c(do_3dplot): Key sample was clipped to graph box
	(2D rectangle around the 3D plotting area), even if the key had
	explicitly been requested to be outside that area by `set key below'
	or `set key outside'.

2000-04-10  Lars Hecking  <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>

	* term/fig.trm(FIG_put_text): Don't create xfig SPECIAL_TEXT for
	non-LaTeX strings. See Debian bug#61972.

	* term/png.trm(PNG_options): Fix parser bug. Noted by
	Benoit des Ligneris <benoit.des.ligneris@physique.usherb.ca>.

2000-04-07  Pieter-Tjerk de Boer  <ptdeboer@cs.utwente.nl>

	* src/show.c(show_mtics): Fix buggy `show m[xyz][2]tics'command.

2000-04-06  Lars Hecking  <lhecking@nmrc.ucc.ie>

	* docs/gnuplot.doc, src/plot2d.c, src/plot3d.c, src/set.c,
	src/setshow.h: Bug fix for broken autoscale writeback, see BUGS
	entry 3.

2000-04-05  Hans-Bernhard Broeker  <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>

	* src/interpol.c(cp_implode): 'smooth unique' does not correctly
	check inrange/outrange conditions.

2000-04-04  Pieter-Tjerk de Boer <ptdeboer@cs.utwente.nl>

	* src/graph3d.c(do_3dplot): Fix division by zero error caused

	if stdin is not from a tty, events are not processed by default.
	If someone wants event processing when writing from a pipe to
	gnuplot she should turn on the mouse `set mouse` explicitely

2000-02-06  Thomas Henlich <Thomas.Henlich@mailbox.tu-dresden.de>

	* term/post.trm: Some programs complain about "Symbol-Oblique".
	Use "Symbol" instead, because "Symbol-Oblique" is really just a
	transformed "Symbol" font.

2000-02-04  Thomas Henlich <Thomas.Henlich@mailbox.tu-dresden.de>
