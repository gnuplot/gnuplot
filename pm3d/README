Subj: pm3d: new splot mode for gray/colour maps and surfaces

Here a new type of splot mode:  pm3d.  This adds the possibility to draw 
colour/gray maps and surfaces (even without preprocessing!) in addition to 
contours and wired surfaces currently supported. Please look at some 
snapshots of the new functionality at
	- http://www.sci.muni.cz/~mikulik/gnuplot.html
	- http://www.zellner.org/gnuplot

Current (development) gnuplot-mouse-pm3d sources are available from 
the gnuplot CVS tree, branch pm3d, at SourceForge:
  [export | set | setenv] CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gnuplot.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuplot
  cvs login
  cvs -z3 checkout -P -r pm3d gnuplot

pm3d mode works on terminals capable of filled colour polygons. Currently 
supported terminals are:
	OS/2 Presentation Manager
	X11
	Linux VGA
	GGI
	Win
	PostScript
	pslatex, pstex, epslatex
	GIF
	Fig

You are welcome to run pm3d demo. Please use "help set pm3d" and "help set 
palette" for further information.

	demo: demo for pm3d
	contrib: contributions using pm3d (colour points, compress pm3d 
		 postscript file,...)
	old-docs: technical docs from the first public release of pm3d 
		 in January 1999


Compilation:

        - OS/2: uncomment line with  PM3D=1  in Makefile/os2
        - Unix: ./configure --enable-pm3d --enable-mouse
          (if you want several gnuplot_x11 drivers to coexist on your
           system you can additionally choose something like
           --with-X11-driver=gnuplot_x11_pm3d)
        then make

You may download precompiled OS/2 binaries from
